                        scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to

                        (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
                        <br>
                        (2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
